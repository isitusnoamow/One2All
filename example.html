    <h1 style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">When playing with lego, make sure your son understands not to eat them. When he plays with lego characters, such as the policeman or the mailman, make sure that he doesn't get too attached with his toys or who knows he might be using them for the rest of his life. Lego is an excellent tool to let you and your wife to get some time to yourselves.</h3>
